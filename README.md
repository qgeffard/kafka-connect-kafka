# Kafka Connect Kafka Connector

kafka-connect-kafka is a [Kafka Connector](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect)
for loading data to and from Kafka.

# Development

To build a development version you'll need a recent version of Kafka as well as a set of upstream Confluent projects, which you'll have to build from their appropriate snapshot branch.
for guidance on this process.

You can build kafka-connect-kafka with Maven using the standard lifecycle phases.
